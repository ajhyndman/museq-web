# tiny-elm
A very minimal elm starter kit

## Tools

To start building stuff with this kit, you will need a few tools!

* git
* npm
* a command line (cmd on Windows or Terminal on MacOS come pre-installed!)

### git

### npm
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a **package manager** for javascript projects.  You don't need to know too much about it now.

You can install npm (with node) from their official site: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.  (Feel free to install npm via tools like Homebrew, Chocolatey, or NVM if you are more comfortable with them, of course!)

## Starting Your Project

Now that you have a professional developement environment set up, *clone* the repository using this link:

```
https://github.com/ajhyndman/tiny-elm.git
```

Next you will need to open your command line and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository. This should be acheived by typing a command something like this:

```bash
cd C:/Users/YOUR_NAME/SOME/FOLDER
```

Once you're there, install the project dependencies with npm!  This will take a minute or two.

```bash
npm install
```

Now, you're set up!  To build your application, use the helper script:

```bash
npm run build
```

To launch and view the application, use:

```bash
npm run server
```
